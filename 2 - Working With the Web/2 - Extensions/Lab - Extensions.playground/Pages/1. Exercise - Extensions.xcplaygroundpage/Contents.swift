## Exercise - Extensions
 
 Define an extension to `Character` that includes a function `isVowel()`. The function returns `true` if the character is a vowel (a,e,i,o,u), and `false` otherwise. Be sure to properly handle uppercase and lowercase characters.
 */

extension Character {
    func isVowel() -> Bool {

        let vowels: Set<Character> = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]


        return vowels.contains(self)
    }
}

//:  Create two `Character` constants, `myVowel` and `myConsonant`, and set them to a vowel and a consonant, respectively. Use the `isVowel()` methods on each constant to determine whether or not it's a vowel.

let myVowel: Character = "a"
myVowel.isVowel()
let myconsonant: Character = "z"
myconsonant.isVowel()

 
//:  Create a `Rectangle` struct with two variable properties, `length` and `width`, both of type `Double`. Below the definition, write an extension to `Rectangle` that includes a function, `halved()`. This function returns a new `Rectangle` instance with half the length and half the width of the original rectangle.
struct Rectangle {
var length: Int
var width: Int
}

extension Rectangle {
    func halved() -> [Int] {
        return [length / 2, width / 2]
    }
    mutating func half() -> [Int] {
        return self.halved()
    }
}
/*:
 Within the existing `Rectangle` extension, add a new mutating function, `half()`, which updates the original rectangle to have half the length and half the width. Use the `halved()` function as part of the implementation for `half()`.
 
 Below, create a variable `Rectangle` called `myRectangle`, and set its length to 10 and its width to 5. Create a second instance, `mySmallerRectangle`, that's the result of calling `halved()` on `myRectangle`. Then update the values of `myRectangle` by calling `half()` on itself. Print each of the instances.
 */
var myRectangle = Rectangle(length: 10, width: 5)
print(myRectangle.halved())
print(myRectangle.half())
